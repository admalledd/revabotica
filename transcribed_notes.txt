map data structure:::


map save format:::
~~~.map  #pyfs openable dir for reading (zipfile,http,anything really)
    config.json #map size, tile setup, tilegrid size (bytes per tile, layers ect...)
    tile_layers/ #merged pyfs mount, updated files stored elsewhere. stores all tile data
        `LID`.grid #n*x*y byte .zip file of tiles where n is bytes per tile
        `LID`.json #config for a single layer (over-rides main config.json settings)
        `LID`.py   #python script with callback/event listeners that can change the grid.
    entities.json #general entity config file
    entity_layers/ #merged pyfs mount, updated files stored elsewhere. stores all entity data
        `EID`.json #config file with at least 'name','x','y'
        `EID`.py   #python file with coustom code, note that this can only be loaded from ~~~.map, not the state folder! (security)
    robots.json #general robot configurations
    robots/ #merged pyfs mount, update files stored elsewhere. stores all robot data. 
        `RID`.json  #robot config, stores user "program" here, other things as well.
        `RID`.py    #robot code, again note that all .py files can only be loaded from ~~~.map, however note that sharing of a .py file is expected
